You will first need to install Node 12. To do so:
```
wget -qO- https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
```

To start the app, just run from the root folder:
```
npm run start
```

You can change the app port by setting `PORT` env variable.

Two routes are available:
- `\`
- `\healthz`
